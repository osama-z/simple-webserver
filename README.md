# Simple Web Server for Local HTML Files
This project demonstrates how to create a local folder named "html_files," run a web server, and access HTML files through a web browser.

# Getting Started

1.Create the "html_files" Folder
2.Inside the "html_files" folder, create a new file and name it "name.html". Add some HTML content to this file.
3.To run the web server, we'll use Python's built-in HTTP server. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "html_files" folder .

# Accessing the HTML File
Open your web browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:8000/name.html
